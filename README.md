# Image-Compression-with-K-Means-Clustering
This project focuses on  steps involved in k-means clustering. Apply k-means clustering with scikit-learn and Python to compress images. Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter widgets

`images` Folder has 4 images


`compressed_images` folder has 4 compressed images

Here is a Visualization of how algorithm works on data
